# This task uses list comprehension,
# which is one of the key concepts learned in this week's lesson.

# chat history with genAI
# # Given a list of words ‘words’, write a list comprehension (that compares the first
# # and last character of each word and create sa) new list with the smaller character of the two in each word
# # print((you may assume all words are lowercase))
# # For example: words = ['sandbox', 'portabello', 'lion', 'australia', 'salamander']
# # should give you ['s', 'o', 'l', 'a', 'r']
# words = ['sandbox', 'portabello', 'lion', 'australia', 'salamander']
# result = [min(word[0], word[-1]) for word in words]
# print(result)
