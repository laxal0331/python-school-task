#Import Math module and write a program that will get input from a user asking them to enter the radius of a
#circle and then calculate the area of the circle and the result should be printed to the user.
#Formula: Pi * r *r where r is radius

#Summary of Understanding
#In Task 7, we are tasked with calculating the area of a circle using the formula
#Area
#=
#𝜋
#×
#𝑟
#2
#Area=π×r
#2
# , where
#𝑟
#r is the radius of the circle. To achieve this, we will:

#Import the math module to utilize the constant
#𝜋
#π.
#Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.
#Calculate the area using the provided formula.
#Print the result to the user.
#This task effectively demonstrates the application of mathematical concepts and basic programming constructs such as user input, variable assignment, and output.

#Chat History with GenAI
#(Note: As I cannot provide actual chat history, I can summarize potential interactions.)

#User: Can you help me write a program to calculate the area of a circle
#GenAI: Sure! First, you'll need to import the math module to access
#𝜋
#π. Then, prompt the user for the radius.
#User: What’s the formula again?
#GenAI: The area is calculated using
#𝜋
#×
#𝑟
#2
#π×r
#2
#.
#User: Can you provide a code example?
#GenAI: Certainly! Here’s a simple Python program:
#python
#import math

# Get user input
#radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Calculate area
#area = math.pi * radius * radius

# Print the result
#print(f"The area of the circle is: {area}")
#Relation to Unit Content
#Yes, the task has been completed using the concepts learned in this week’s class, which likely included:

#Importing Modules: Understanding how to utilize built-in libraries like math for mathematical operations.
#User Input: Learning how to take input from users, which is a fundamental aspect of interactive programming.
#Basic Arithmetic Operations: Applying mathematical formulas in code to solve real-world problems.
#These concepts align well with the unit's focus on programming fundamentals and mathematical applications, demonstrating how to effectively translate theoretical knowledge into practical programming solutions.
