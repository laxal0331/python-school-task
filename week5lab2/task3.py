# We want to write a function count_most_frequent that takes as input a container that can be iterated over (e.g. a
# list or a string), and returns the most frequent element in the container, as well as the number of times it occurs in
# the container. For example, if the input is ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c'], the output should be the tuple ('a', 2).
# 4
# 5
# In the case of a tie, we should return the most frequent element that appears first in the container. For example, if
# the input is ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b'], the output should be ('a', 2).
# def count_most_frequent(container: object) -> (object, int):
#     """ Finds and counts the number of occurrences of the most frequent element (using == for comparing)
#         In case of a tie, the tied element that appears first is picked.
#           Parameters:

#            Returns:
#                 a list with (the most frequent element, the number of occurrences),
